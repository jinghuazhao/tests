# Miscellaneous AI-related materials in Python

The exercises are greatly faciliated by Google Colab, <https://colab.research.google.com/>.

Notably, follow "Runtime" --> "Change runtime type" to enable GPU.

Local setup is noted in MLD.sh.

## 1. Math for Deep Learning

This is illustrated by mnist.py <- NN.py.

## 2. Ultimate Neural Network Programming with Python

* Chapter 9, we have mlp.ipynb and miso_nn_tensorflow.ipynb

## Visualization

- stable_diffusion.ipynb, <https://nbviewer.org/github/jinghuazhao/tests/blob/main/AI/python/stable_diffusion.ipynb>
