# Miscellaneous AI-related materials in Python

The exercises are greatly faciliated by Google Colab, <https://colab.research.google.com/>.

Notably, follow "Runtime" --> "Change runtime type" to enable GPU.

Local setup is noted in MDL.sh.

## 1. Math for Deep Learning

GitHub, <https://github.com/rkneusel9/MathForDeepLearning>

This is illustrated by

* Chapter 10, mnist.py <- NN.py.

## 2. Ultimate Neural Network Programming with Python

GitHub, <https://github.com/OrangeAVA/Ultimate-Neural-Network-Programming-with-Python>

* Chapter 9, we have mlp.ipynb and miso_nn_tensorflow.ipynb.
* Chapter 10, we have ft.ipynb.

## Browsing / Visualization

We have two prefixes for

- Browsing .py from GitHub code from <https://github.com/jinghuazhao/tests/blob/main/AI/python/>, e.g.,
    * **mnist.py**, <https://github.com/jinghuazhao/tests/blob/main/AI/python/mnist.py>.
- Visualization of .ipynb from <https://nbviewer.org>, e.g.,
    * **stable_diffusion.ipynb**, <https://nbviewer.org/github/jinghuazhao/tests/blob/main/AI/python/stable_diffusion.ipynb>
