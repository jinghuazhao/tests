# Hugging Face

Install Necessary Libraries: Ensure you have the transformers, datasets, and torch libraries installed.

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch torchvision
```

Load a Pretrained Model and Tokenizer: Hugging Face offers various pretrained models suitable for image classification tasks. For instance, you can use a Vision Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on ImageNet.

```python
from transformers import AutoFeatureExtractor, AutoModelForImageClassification
model_name = "google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k"
extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

The Hugging Face models can be listed with `huggingface-cli scan-cache`.

Load the ImageNet Dataset: Hugging Face provides access to subsets of the ImageNet dataset. For example, the imagenet-1k dataset contains images across 1,000 object classes.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("imagenet-1k")
```

Preprocess and Classify Images: Use the extractor to preprocess images and the model to obtain predictions.

```python
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
from PIL import Image

# Define the image transform
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

# Load and preprocess an image
image = Image.open("path_to_image.jpg")
image = transform(image).unsqueeze(0)  # Add batch dimension

# Forward pass through the model
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(image)
    logits = outputs.logits
    predicted_class_idx = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1).item()

# Map the predicted class index to a label
labels = dataset["train"].features["label"].names
predicted_label = labels[predicted_class_idx]
print(f"Predicted label: {predicted_label}")
```

This script loads a pretrained ViT model, processes an input image, and predicts its class based on the ImageNet-1k dataset.

Note: Ensure that the image you are processing is compatible with the model's expected input size and format.
Adjust the transform parameters as needed based on the model's requirements.
