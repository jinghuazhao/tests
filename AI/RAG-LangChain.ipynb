    "# A Practical Guide to Building Local RAG Applications with LangChain\n",

    "\n",
    "**Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** encompasses a family of systems that extend conventional language models, large and otherwise (LLMs), to incorporate context based on retrieved knowledge from a document base. This integration leads to more truthful and relevant responses to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, **LangChain** has gained particular attention as a framework that simplifies the development of RAG applications. It provides orchestration tools for integrating LLMs with external data sources, managing retrieval pipelines, and handling complex workflows in a robust and scalable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article offers a practical, step-by-step guide to building a simple local RAG application with LangChain using Python. It serves as an introductory resource, supplementing the foundational concepts covered in the \"Understanding RAG\" series. If you're new to RAG and seek a theoretical background, consider reviewing that series first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Practical Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into building our first local RAG system with LangChain. For reference, the following diagram, adapted from \"Understanding RAG Part II,\" illustrates a simplified version of a basic RAG system and its core components.\n",

    "**1. Installing Necessary Libraries**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install the required libraries and frameworks. The latest versions of LangChain may require `langchain-community`, so it's included in the installation. FAISS is a framework for efficient similarity search in a vector database. For loading and using existing LLMs, we'll use Hugging Face’s `transformers` and `sentence-transformers` libraries, the latter providing pre-trained models optimized for sentence-level text embeddings."
