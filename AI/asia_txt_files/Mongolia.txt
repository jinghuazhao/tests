Mongolia, while geographically in East Asia, has a culture that is distinct from its neighbors. It is known for its vast steppes, nomadic traditions, and historical connection to Genghis Khan. Ulaanbaatar, the capital, serves as the country’s cultural and economic center. The Naadam Festival, featuring horse racing, wrestling, and archery, showcases Mongolia’s rich heritage.
