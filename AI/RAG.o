Question: What is RAG and how does it work?
Answer: RAG is a technique that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches for natural language processing tasks. It involves retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base and using it to generate more accurate and informed responses. RAG models first retrieve documents that are relevant to a given query, then use these documents as additional context for language generation. This approach helps to ground the model's responses in factual information and reduces hallucinations.

Question: How does LocalAI relate to cloud AI services?
Answer: LocalAI is a framework that enables running AI models locally without relying on cloud services. It provides APIs compatible with OpenAI's interfaces, allowing developers to use their own models with the same code they would use for OpenAI services. This means that LocalAI allows developers to run AI models on consumer hardware without requiring high-end GPUs, which are typically used in cloud AI services.
