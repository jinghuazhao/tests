## Footnotes

[^gold]: **Gold/**

    This follows the example of Morgan.

    As suggested by Cohen, kappa results should be interpreted as follows: values ≤ 0 as indicating no agreement, 0.01–0.20 as slight, 0.21–0.40 as fair, 0.41–0.60 as moderate, 0.61–0.80 as substantial and 0.81–1.00 as almost perfect agreement.
