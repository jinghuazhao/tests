We have two xlsx files and wish to produce a plot similar to [nihms-1589535-f0001.jpg](nihms-1589535-f0001.jpg).

The script [circos.R](circos.R) produced a few .csv files as needed by shinyCircos, which gave
[shinyCircos.pdf](shinyCircos.pdf) and also [shinyCircos.svg](shinyCircos.svg).

Is it possible to 

* color the data points/texts?
* have a script which generates shinyCircos.* -- we only get components of the plot as it is?
* achieve a more ambitious goal to have a y-axis with ticks -- forget about this one now since it sounds difficult?
